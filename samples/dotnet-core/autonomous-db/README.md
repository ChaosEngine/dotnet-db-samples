The ODP.NET Core Autonomous Database (ADB) code sample in the "console" subdirectory is intended to be used with the [Developing .NET Core Applications for Oracle Autonomous Database tutorial](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/dotnet/adbdotnetcore.html). 

This sample demonstrates how to connect to Oracle Autonomous Database, including Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing and Autonomous Data Warehouse.

Create a new .NET Core console project, add ODP.NET Core assembly ([Oracle.ManagedDataAccess.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Oracle.ManagedDataAccess.Core/)) from NuGet Gallery, and paste the sample code. You can then enter your ADB connection and configuration information into the pasted sample code as described in the comments.

This repository has ADB code samples for ODP.NET Core, managed ODP.NET, and unmanaged ODP.NET. This directory contains the 
ODP.NET Core sample. The other ODP.NET Autonomous DB samples are located [here](https://github.com/oracle/dotnet-db-samples/tree/master/samples/autonomous-db).

The "asp.net-core" subdirectory contains an ADB sample using ASP.NET Core and ODP.NET Core.
