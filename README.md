<H2>About Oracle .NET</H2>
This repository provides .NET code samples for Oracle developers, specifically for Oracle Data Provider for .NET (ODP.NET)
and other Oracle .NET components. .NET products for Oracle Database are free of charge. They consist of:

<ul>
<li>Oracle Data Provider for .NET (ODP.NET) - an optimized ADO.NET data access provider to the Oracle database. ODP.NET allows developers to take advantage of advanced Oracle database functionality, including Real Application Clusters, XML DB, and self-updating client caches. ODP.NET offers three provider types: Core for .NET (Core) runtimes, managed for .NET Framework (100% managed code and easy deployment), and unmanaged for .NET Framework.</li>
<li>Oracle Developer Tools for Visual Studio - a tightly integrated design-time "Add-in" for Microsoft Visual Studio that provides full Oracle .NET application lifecycle management, including PL/SQL debugging and schema comparison tools.</li>
  <li>Oracle Developer Tools for VS Code - enables Visual Studio Code developers to connect to Oracle Database and Oracle Autonomous Database, edit SQL and PL/SQL with autocomplete, Intellisense, breadcrumbs, and syntax coloring, execute SQL and PL/SQL and view and save the results in formats such as .CSV and JSON. The Oracle Database Explorer tree control allows you to quickly explore your database schema, view table data, and edit, execute and save PL/SQL.</li>
<li>Oracle Providers for ASP.NET - a collection of ASP.NET providers that use Oracle Database as the data source. ASP.NET applications can store various types of website state in an Oracle database, which can then be shared across the application.</li>
<li>Oracle Database Extensions for .NET - a feature of Oracle Database on Windows that makes it easy to develop, deploy, and run stored procedures and functions written in a .NET managed language</li>
</ul>
