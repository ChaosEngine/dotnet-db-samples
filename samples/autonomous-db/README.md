These ODP.NET Autonomous Database code samples are intended to be used with the [Developing .NET Framework Applications for Oracle Autonomous Database tutorial](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/dotnet/adbdotnetfw.html). 

This sample demonstrates how to connect to Oracle Autonomous Database, including Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing and Autonomous Data Warehouse.

Create a new .NET Framework project and add either managed or unmanaged ODP.NET assembly. Oracle recommends using managed ODP.NET for most .NET Framework apps. Managed ODP.NET ([Oracle.ManagedDataAccess](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Oracle.ManagedDataAccess)) can be downloaded from NuGet Gallery. Unmanaged ODP.NET can be added after an [ODAC installation](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/dotnet-odacdeploy-downloads.html). Paste the sample code into the project. You can then enter your ADB connection and configuration information into the sample code as described in the comments.

This directory contains the 
managed and unmanaged ODP.NET samples. The ODP.NET Core sample is located [here](https://github.com/oracle/dotnet-db-samples/tree/master/samples/dotnet-core/autonomous-db).
